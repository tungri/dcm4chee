dcm4che is an implementation in java of the DICOM  (=Digital Imaging and
Communications in Medicine) standard, which addresses the exchange of digital
information between medical imaging equipment.

Additionally to the core library, which is splitted into a specification part 
and the (reference) implementation, it also contains (sample) applications
which are useful for (end-)users on its own. 

dcm4che 1.x is a complete rewrite of dcm4che 0.9.9 for java 1.4 (J2SE 1.4).
dcm4che 1.x only contains the DICOM core implementation.
The - also rewritten - IHE compliant image archive, based on J2EE/EJB 2.0,
is available as separate package: dcm4jboss 1.x.

Improvements of the DICOM Implementation in dcm4che 1.x against
dcm4che 0.x.x are
+ import/export of XML presentation of DICOM Data-Sets
+ serializable Data-Set (will simplify communication to EJBs)
+ increase robustness of FSM of DICOM UL protocol engine
+ support of asynchrone operation mode
:

But I have not yet found any time to update the documentation to v1.x.
So, I can only invite everyone, to improve the documentation by his/her own 
contributions.  

Have Fun,
